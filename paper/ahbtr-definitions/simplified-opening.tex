The traceability of AH-BTR guarantees that a traitor must be found (if the decoder is good enough) and innocent users must not be accused (whether or not the decoder is good enough).
Decomposing the two requirements (plus some apparent weakening) makes each of them simpler (in particular, \emph{non-interactive}) in the decentralized setting.
The first requirement is called \emph{completeness}, and the second \emph{soundness}.
