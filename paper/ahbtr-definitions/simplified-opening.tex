The traceability of AH-BTR guarantees that a traitor must be found (if the decoder has high advantage) and innocent users must not be accused (regardless of the advantage of the decoder).
Decomposing the two requirements (plus some apparent weakening) makes each of them simpler (in particular, \emph{non-interactive}) in the decentralized setting.
The first requirement is called \emph{completeness}, and the second \emph{soundness}.
