This section concerns the definitions for \ad hoc broadcast, trace, and revoke.
After formally defining the syntax and correctness of AH-BTR,
we present an intuitive definition of its security.
While the security definition is comprehensive,
it is not the easiest to work with, so
we turn to define two simpler security notions, whose conjunction is equivalent to the comprehensive definition.
The proof of their equivalence follows the definitions.
Later in this paper, we will only work with the simpler notions.
