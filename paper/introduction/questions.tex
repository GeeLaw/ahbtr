\subsubsection{Open Questions.}
The tracing model in this work is black-box and classical, and recent works~\cite{C:Zhandry21,TCC:Zhandry20} have studied white-box or quantum traitor tracing.
It would be interesting to understand the \ad hoc versions of those tracing models.

Another question for future investigation is whether
AH-BTR can be constructed from more lightweight assumptions,
such as group- or lattice-based ones,
without going through obfuscation.
This appears to require significant deviation from existing paradigms,
as typical group-based or lattice-based constructions
share public parameters among all parties
so that their keys can be correlated and ciphertexts compressed,
yet the motivation of AH-BTR repels any use of public parameters.
See related works for more discussion on the technical challenges.
