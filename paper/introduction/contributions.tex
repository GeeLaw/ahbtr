\subsubsection{Our Contributions.}
In this work, we define \ad hoc traitor tracing and construct a secure scheme based on functional encryption for general circuits.
Ignoring polynomial factors in the security parameter,
our scheme achieves public and secret keys of length~$\bigO(1)$, ciphertexts of length~$\bigO(N^{1-\gamma})$, encryption time~$\bigO(N)$, and decryption time~$\bigO(N^\gamma)$, for any constant ${0\leq\gamma\leq 1}$.
In addition, the scheme is \emph{compatible} with the existing public-key infrastructure,
i.e., the keys of such a scheme can be those of any secure public-key encryption, and
there is no need to regenerate keys to take advantage of our scheme.
