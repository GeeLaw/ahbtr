\subsubsection{Related Works.}
We discuss several related works.

\paragraph{\Ad Hoc, Decentralized, or Distributed Broadcast.}
Decentralized versions of broadcast encryption were
studied in~\cite{SCN:PhaPoiStr12,PAIRING:DelPaiPoi07}
with interactive management of recipient sets.
\Ad hoc (a.k.a.~distributed; potentially threshold) broadcast encryption was
studied in several prior/later works,
all of which only considered bounded schemes.
Pairing-based constructions~\cite{DHMR08,CCS:WQZD10,KolMalWee23}
require global set-up, and
the obfuscation-based one~\cite{C:BonZha14} do not.

\paragraph{Lower Bounds.}
Previous works~\cite{EC:BluCre94,EC:LubSta98,AC:KYDB98,AFRICACRYPT:AusKre08,AC:KatYer09,C:GayKerWee15,ITC:DLY21} show a few efficiency lower bounds related to ABE and BE,
yet they only apply to information-theoretically secure primitives and even specific construction techniques.
Moreover, all of them prove space (ciphertext or secret key size, or their trade-off) lower bounds, whereas
this work is about space-time trade-offs.
Based on obfuscation~\cite{C:BonWatZha14} or both LWE and pairing~\cite{EC:AgrYam20}, broadcast encryption with ${|\ct|,|\sk|=\bigO(1)}$ can be achieved,
circumventing all previously known bounds.
In a concurrent work~\cite{EC:JaiLinLuo23},
lower bounds of (partially hiding) functional encryption are shown.
