\subsubsection{Simplifying Security Notions.}
Traditionally~\cite{EC:BonSahWat06}, traceability has been defined using one comprehensive interactive experiment,%
% The definition of TCC:CVWWW18 seems to have a problem...
% In the first version of ePrint 2018/897, on p.19, the definition of
% tracing security requires
%     Pr[GoodDecoder && BadTrace] = negligible,
% which does not (from a definitional point of view) prevent Trace
% from accusing an innocent user if D has advantage 0.
% The black-box confirmation model (where there is separate
% confirmation/soundness notion) is not as related as I anticipated,
% and mentioning here should be good enough.
\footnote{While some previous works~\cite{C:BonFra99,STOC:GoyKopWat18,C:Zhandry20} separate traceability into multiple notions,
those notions still share one single complicated security experiment.}
which is complicated to work with.
Intuitively, the notion requires that
\emph{i})~a traitor should be found from a decoder with sufficient advantage and
\emph{ii})~no honest user should be identified as a traitor, regardless of the decoder advantage.

We thus define two security notions for AH-BTR capturing the requirements separately.
The former is called \emph{completeness} and the latter is called \emph{soundness}.
Their conjunction is equivalent to \emph{traceability}.
Since only one requirement is considered in each notion,
both of them can be vastly simplified and the interactions in those notions are minimal.
They are also more convenient for reductionist proofs.
