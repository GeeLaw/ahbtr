\subsubsection{Simplifying Security Notions.}
\luoji{Pending citations.}
Traditionally, traceability has been defined using one comprehensive interactive experiment, which is complicated to work with.
Intuitively, the notion requires that
\emph{i})~a traitor should be found from a decoder with sufficient advantage and
\emph{ii})~no honest user should be identified as a traitor, regardless of the decoder advantage.

We thus define two security notions for AH-BTR capturing the requirements separately.
\luoji{Compare with ``confirmation property''?
Previous work also already has ``soundness''.}
The former is called \emph{completeness} and the latter is called \emph{soundness}.
Their conjunction is equivalent to \emph{traceability}.
Since only one requirement is considered in each notion,
both of them can be vastly simplified and the interactions in those notions are minimal.
It can be seen later that the they are also more convenient for reductionist proofs.
