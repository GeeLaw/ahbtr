We denote by~${\lambda\in\doubleN}$ the security parameter,
by~$\poly({\cdot})$ a polynomial function, and
by~$\negl(\lambda)$ a negligible function of~$\lambda$.
Efficient algorithms are probabilistic random-access machines $M^w(x)$ of running time~$\poly(|x|,|w|)$.
Efficient adversaries (in interactive experiments) can be either circuits of (total) size~$\poly(\lambda)$ or probabilistic Turing machines of (total) running time~$\poly(\lambda)$.
We use $\approx,\approxS,\equiv$ for computational indistinguishability, statistical indistinguishability, and identity.

Under the standard assumption that a pseudorandom generator (with polynomial security) exists,
we can assume, whenever convenient, that a randomized algorithm uses a uniformly random $\lambda$-bit string as its randomness (without losing polynomial security considered in this work).

For~${n,n'\in\doubleN}$, we write $[n..n']$ for the set~$\{n,\dots,n'\}$,
and $[n]$ for~$[1..n]$.
