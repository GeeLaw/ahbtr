\subsubsection{Assumption.}
All of the primitives defined in this section are implied by the existence of
weakly selectively secure, single key, and sublinearly succinct
public-key functional encryption for general circuits
(so-called \emph{obfuscation-minimum PKFE}),
of which we refer the reader to~\cite{C:KNTY19} for the precise definition.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:poly-assumption}
Suppose there exists an \emph{obfuscation-minimum PKFE} with polynomial security, then there exist

\item \MyCite{\cite{C:LinTes17,TCC:LiuZha17}}

\end{itemize}
with polynomial security.

\noindent
Alternatively, those primitives can be based on the existence of {\iO} and one-way function.
However, {\iO} security is not known to be \emph{somewhat falsifiable}~\cite{C:Naor03} and it is hard to conceive~\cite{STOC:GGSW13} a reduction of {\iO} security to \emph{complexity assumptions}~\cite{TCC:GolKal16}.
In contrast, obfuscation-minimum PKFE security is somewhat falsifiable and there are constructions from well-studied complexity assumptions~\cite{STOC:JaiLinSah21,EPRINT:JaiLinSah21corrected}.
The point of Lemma~\ref{lem:poly-assumption} is to base our constructions solely on somewhat falsifiable assumptions, or even complexity assumptions.
