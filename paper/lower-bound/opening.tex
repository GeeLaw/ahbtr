\luoji{Consider paying a tribute to Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)
by using the phrase ``You Can (Not) Optimize''.}
In this section, we prove that for all secure AH-BTR,
\begin{align*}
|\ct|\TDec
\geq\left(\frac14-\epsilon\right)N
=\Omega(N).
\end{align*}
for some negligible~$\epsilon$.
In fact, we will show a related bound against statically 1-key secure attribute-based encryption schemes with a certain functionality,%
\footnote{Therefore, we also have a lower bound for ABE in general.}
which can be implemented using AH-BTR in a straight-forward manner.
