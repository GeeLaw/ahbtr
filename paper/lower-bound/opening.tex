\luoji{Consider paying a tribute to Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)
by using the phrase ``You Can (Not) Optimize''.}
In this section, we prove that for all secure AH-BTR,
\begin{align*}
|\ct|\cdot\TDec=\Omega(N),
\end{align*}
and therefore, we have constructed all the optimal (ignoring $\poly(\lambda)$ factors) AH-BTR schemes in this work.
In fact, we will show a related bound against a restricted kind of broadcast encryption,%
\footnote{This result is thus also a lower bound for general attribute-based encryption.}
which can be implemented using AH-BTR in a straight-forward manner.
