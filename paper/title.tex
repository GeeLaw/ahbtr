% When using different names in different formats (c.f., \authorJiLuo),
% it is the best to dumb-down any such control sequences
% before sending the files to the publisher.
% For added fool-proof,
% remove (not just, e.g., comment) the \author using \authorJiLuo, and
% do the same for \authorpdf.
% Springer could get author names wrong if this is not done.
