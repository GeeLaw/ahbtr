\maketitle

% It is advisable to always include \titlerunning and \authorrunning,
% even if they are the default ones Springer will work out for you.
% Running title and running author list should be tested.
%
% The only version suitable for having them typeset is \CameraReadyIACR,
% but the author of this template has chosen to not do this.
% So unfortunately, to test running title and running author list,
% you need to manually uncomment line 38 of .laomian/llncs.tex.
%
% Test it with \CameraReadyIACR, \CameraReadySpringer, or \CameraReady.
% - For \Submission..., the (running) author list is forced to be empty.
% - For \...WorkInProgress, the file is one-side and
%   the running author list (on even pages) is never shown.
% - For \ePrint..., there is no running title or running author list.
