% [BSW06] defines PLBE with the mode for tracing using a separate tracing key.
% A question is thus what ``private'' refers to in the name, is it
% - the privacy of the cut-off index, or
% - the fact that tracing-mode encryption uses non-public key?
% The answer should be the former, as in the introduction, [BSW06] says
% > The main security requirement is that the system should be *private* [1].
% and [1] refers to ``private broadcast encryption'', and the surrounding
% text gives a feeling that ``private'' refers to the former.
