\subsubsection{Security.}
\luoji{Tracing is naturally (do not claim ``inherently'') public as nobody is a central authority.
Maybe note the difference to the original PLBE as the tracing key is non-existent and there isn't a ``mode indistinguishability''?}
We define security notions of AH-PLBE analogously to those in~\cite{EC:BonSahWat06}.
