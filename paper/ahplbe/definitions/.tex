\luoji{Add definition for efficiency!}
The above definition of correctness does not take into account
% Since an adversarially generated key could be ``well-formed'',
% the correct phrasing is ``adversarially generated'', but it is a mouthful.
adversarially generated (malformed) public keys.
It is easy though tedious
% It is left as an exercise for the reader
to define \emph{robustness} so that normally generated key pairs enjoy correctness even if the list contains malformed public keys
and show that a tweaked version of Construction~\ref{con:ahplbe} achieves robustness.

\subsubsection{Security.}
\luoji{Tracing is naturally (do not claim ``inherently'') public as nobody is a central authority.
Maybe note the difference to the original PLBE as the tracing key is non-existent and there isn't a ``mode indistinguishability''?}
We define security notions of AH-PLBE analogously to those in~\cite{EC:BonSahWat06}.
