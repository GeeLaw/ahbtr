\subsubsection{Security.}
We define security notions of AH-PLBE analogously to those in~\cite{EC:BonSahWat06}, except ``mode indistinguishability'' (Game~1 in~\cite{EC:BonSahWat06}), which is not needed here.
The two security definitions have a one-to-one correspondence to the simplified security notions of AH-BTR in \Section~\ref{sec:ahbtr-simplified-security}.
Namely, \emph{message-hiding} translates to \emph{completeness}, and
\emph{index-hiding} translates to \emph{soundness}.
