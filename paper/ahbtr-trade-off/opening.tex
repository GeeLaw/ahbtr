While Construction~\ref{con:ahbtr-from-ahplbe} achieves constant ciphertext size,
it takes time $\Omega(N)$ to decrypt.
In contrast, the na{\"i}ve scheme that encrypts to each user separately has $\Omega(N)$-size ciphertext,
yet decryption only takes constant time.
By grouping the recipients and encrypting to each group separately,
we can trade ciphertext size for decryption time.%
\footnote{Alternatively, one can reformulate Construction~\ref{con:ahbtr-from-ahplbe} as a compiler that trades decryption time for ciphertext size, by grouping the recipients and compressing the groups.
We refrained from such a formulation because the ``transformation'' uses a quite strong additional assumption, namely functional encryption for general circuits.}
Previous work~\cite{C:Zhandry20} already systemizes the idea of grouping in the context of traditional traitor tracing.
