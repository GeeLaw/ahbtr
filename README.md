This is an “open-thoughts” (an approximant of “open-source”) research. The motivation to make the repository public is to make the thought-process in the course of writing (ultimately, that in the course of research) reproducible, allowing everyone to dig into the topic the same way the author did. It is great if this is helpful to other researchers, yet there is no such guarantee.

Questions can be asked by the traditional way of e-mailing me, the author, or by creating an issue in this repository. However, this repository will not accept any contribution that could alter the authorship. If you have new ideas arising from this research project that you would like to pursue, consider starting your own project, and cite this research result if appropriate.

> No mathematical idea has ever been published in the way it was discovered. Techniques have been developed and are used, if a problem has been solved, to turn the solution procedure upside down, or if it is a larger complex of statements and theories, to turn definitions into propositions, and propositions into definitions, the hot invention into icy beauty. — Freudenthal
