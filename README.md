# Ad Hoc (Decentralized) Broadcast, Trace, and Revoke

This is an open-source research. The motivation to make the repository public is to make the thought-process in the course of writing reproducible, allowing everyone to dig into the topic. It is great if open-sourcing is helpful to researchers, yet there is no such guarantee.

Questions can be asked by the traditional way of e-mailing me, the author, or by creating an issue in this repository. However, this repository will not accept any contribution that could alter the authorship. If you have new ideas arising from this research project that you would like to pursue, consider starting your own project, and cite this research result if appropriate.
